# Computer

Computer is obviously essential for software engineer.

## Laptop or desktop

I recommend laptop over desktop, as currently laptop is power enough, if not as powerful as desktop.

* Laptop is powerful enough, especially supported by cloud based service, for code and others.
* Laptop is convenience to take, to places like coffee shops.

## MacOS or Windows or Linux

Currently, there are 3 mainstream desktop class operating systems, MacOS, Windows and Linux. Unless you are building a single purpose machine for coding only, otherwise, I recommend MacOS or Windows.

* Peace of mind. Once installation is done, everything are in place.
* Retore to previous state. MacOS is much better in this aspect, as far as configured properly with iCloud backup.
* Good termimal support. As software engineer, especially support the backend and browser based development, good terminal is required.
* Docker support. This is important for development in modern era.
* Windows, native or running in VM, is required if business desktop development is required. As in Business world, Windows is still most popular desktop OS, and .Net is the framework for desktop development for Windows.

I am now using MacOS. Running Windows in Parallel if needed.

## Cost and configuration

* Prioritize memory over CPU. In general software development, any CPU today is powerful enough. But memory is always in demand, especially running Docker and other virtualized components, like Docker or Parallel.
* Disk space, SSD is minimum for primary disk, 512G is ok, but 1T or above is running docker images repositories.
